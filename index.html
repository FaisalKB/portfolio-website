<h3 class = "text-lg"> Hello, I'm Faisal!</h3>
<p> I'm a software Developer living in Dallas, TX. Breaking into the tech industry, I bring along a repertoire of talent, including:</p>
<ul class = "list-inside center-text">
  <li>Problem solving in the form of critical thinking and innovative implementation.</li>
  <li>Teamwork in the form of peer collaboration and consistency calibration. </li>
  <li>Complex task management in the form of multitasking, delegation and practical goal assessment.</li>
</ul> <!-- this list is unordered, meaning none of these items have any particular order or rank. This fit best in my intoduction, where I want to emphasize my qualities equally -->

<!-- I broke apart my main container into three sections: an intro section, an about me, and a contact section. This allowed me to style these individually using the css while maintaining the body's original style. This also breaks up the content to make it easier to read and style -->
<p>Take a look over my portfolio and please feel free to <a href = #contact> contact me! </a></p>

<h3 class = "text-lg">Who is Faisal?</h3>
<p>Graduating from Richland College, I found myself a blank canvas out there, waiting to be explored. Coming from a diverse background of varying industries, I always return to the path of my passions. With a craving for solving problems and an affinity for computer skills, I found the next step for my career could only be a software developer. </p>

<p> Joining Thinkful as a student, I aim to develop my portfolio, my talent profile and my skills, to bring innovation and passion to the world of coding and software engineering!</p>

<p>When not dreaming of becoming a proficient coder, I push myself at the gym, I tend to my plants and I raid in the popular MMO Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
