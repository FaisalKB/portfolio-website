<h3 class = "text-lg"> Hello, I'm Faisal!</h3>
<p> I'm a software Developer living in Dallas, TX. Breaking into the tech industry, I bring along a repertoire of talent, including:</p>
<ul class = "list-inside list-align">
  <li>Problem solving in the form of critical thinking and innovative implementation.</li>
  <li>Teamwork in the form of peer collaboration and consistency calibration. </li>
  <li>Complex task management in the form of multitasking, delegation and practical goal assessment.</li>
</ul> <!-- REVISION: Fixed list alignment to better align bullet points, makes website much more accessible and readable -->


<p>Take a look over my portfolio and please feel free to <a href = #contact> contact me! </a></p>

<h3 class = "text-lg">Who is Faisal?</h3> <!-- class added to my h3 titles to allow them to be styled slightly differently from the rest of the section -->
<p>Graduating from Richland College, I found myself a blank canvas out there, waiting to be explored. Coming from a diverse background of varying industries, I always return to the path of my passions. With a craving for solving problems and an affinity for computer skills, I found the next step for my career could only be a software developer. </p>

<p> Joining Thinkful as a student, I aim to develop my portfolio, my talent profile and my skills, to bring innovation and passion to the world of coding and software engineering!</p>

<p>When not dreaming of becoming a proficient coder, I push myself at the gym, I tend to my plants and I raid in the popular MMO Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
