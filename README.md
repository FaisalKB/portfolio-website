# Portfolio Website (Legacy)
![Alt text](images/updated-github-header.jpg)

## A humble attempt at beginner-level web design.
First ever project in coding using basic/minimal HTML/CSS. A legacy project that I keep as a reminder of where I started.
A link to the deployed site can be found [here](https://faisalkb.github.io/portfolio-website/)!
